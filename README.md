# CS210 -- Corner Grocer

In this assignment, the main goal was to create an interactive menu by integrating Python into C++ in order to cleanly list the number of times unique items were purchased. The tasks assigned were as follows:

  1. Produce a list of all items purchased on a given day along with the number of times the item was purchased.
  2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
  3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased on a givem day.

The program required that the menu be written in C++. while the functions within the menu are carried out by Python.
