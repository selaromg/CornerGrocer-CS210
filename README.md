# CS210 -- Corner Grocer

In this assignment, the main goal was to create an interactive menu by integrating Python into C++ in order to cleanly list the number of times unique items were purchased. The tasks assigned were as follows:

  1. Produce a list of all items purchased on a given day along with the number of times the item was purchased.
  2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
  3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased on a givem day.

The program required that the menu be written in C++. while the functions within the menu are carried out by Python.


**What did you do particularly well?**
In this project, I was able to neatly modularize the entire project so that there is minimal coding within main. I feel that one of my main strengths is my ability to create modularized programs which greatly aids with debugging and future changes.

**Where could you enhance your code?**
In the original attempt, I was unable to use matplotlib but upon further review I see that it is unnecessary therefore I can enhance the code by creating a text-based histogram as required thereby completing and enhancing the project.

**Which pieces did you find most challening to write?**
The toughest part was getting the modules to work correctly. I found out that I was utilizing the wrong module name which is what was causing the issue, so keeping track is probably one of the more challenging aspects. However, throughout my journey thus far StackOverflow, Zybooks, and the class general discussions have been a great help.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable?**
The main takeaway from this project is the ability to integrate Python and C++ which opens the door to many possibilities I did not know existed before.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
In this program, I made sure to keep it modular which goes a long way in maintaining readability and adaptability within a program.
